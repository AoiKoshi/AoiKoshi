# Hi there!

### [Check out me](www.kruzeraptor.co.uk)

I'm a budding game developer with a penchant for tackling difficult problems and coming up with creative solutions! You can find some of my personal projects on here, with my team and university projects available on my website.

My primary role in projects so far has been gameplay programming and design, with some experience in VR, networking and UI implementation. I also dabble in level design in small scale projects.

Many of my projects so far have been developed in Unity utilising C# following an agile development methodology. I am also acquainted with Unreal Engine, developing my skill with C++ and Blueprints.
